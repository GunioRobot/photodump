## _plugins/photo dump

Hi, I'm envious of how easy it is for [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/culturomnivore) users to drop photos into a folder and instantly have a blog post.  I'm trying to replicate that functionality with this plugin.

Right now this plugin doesn't work with pagination because of the load order of generators... and that makes me sad.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!
